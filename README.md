## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned that not everything needs to be responsive. This is a very simple site that can work across all platforms with a fixed width of the main container.

### Continued development

I would like to continue learning more about CSS. There are concepts I have yet to practice.
